        First off, thanks for visiting my Portfolio. I am a Junior Full stack developer specializing mostly in Javascript.
        I am also a 3rd Year IT student at BDU, Poly Campus.
        Around 8 months ago I started this Journey, though it was challenging since day one it was also genuinely satisfying and something that I ended up loving and doing every day.
        I am currently looking forward for an internship this summer, so I am open to communicate with any tech company that is interested.
